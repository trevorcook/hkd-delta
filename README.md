# hkd-delta

A library for finding differences in higher kinded data (HKD).


```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module Test where

import HKD.Delta
import GHC.Generics
import Generics.OneLiner
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.Text as T
```

## A simple example
The HasDelta class is central to this library, with it we declare how
differences in a type are measured, whether or not the differences
can always be measured, and functions for measuring and applying differences.
The below, for example, declares that 'Text' has a difference, 'Change Text',
(Where the 'Change' type is equivalent to 'Maybe'--but treated specially in
some cases by this library). The instance states that the difference will
allways be measurable, and the calc and apply methods just look for non-equal
values.

```haskell
instance HasDelta Text where
  type DeltaOf Text = Change Text
  type DeltaAlways Text = True
  calcDelta = calcDeltaNEQ
  applyDelta = applyDeltaNEQ

neqText = calcDelta @Text "a" "ab"
--neqTex = Changed "ab"
eqText = calcDelta @Text "a" "a"
-- eqText = Unchanged
```

## Deltas for Higher Kinded Data: Delta Kinded Data

Having defined a basic type, we next look at automatically generating
delta functionality for more interesting types.
First, we define a data type in Higher Kinded Data style

```haskell
type Citizen = Citizen' Z
data Citizen' f = Citizen { name        :: HK f Text
                          , occupation  :: HK f Text }
                    deriving Generic
deriving instance (Constraints (Citizen' f) Show)  --provided by one-liner
  => Show (Citizen' f)
```

Each field in our data is parameterized by a type constructor,
`f`, and a type function, `HK` which together control the expression of the
data at that field. A custom defined `Z` "escapes" from higher kinding,
allowing the data to just be itself. Another custom designed data,
`Delta` makes the data express the `DeltaReturn` of the data, which--
generally--is either a change in the data or a new copy of the data.

```haskell
data Z a
data Delta a
type family HK (f :: * -> *) (a :: *) :: * where
  HK Z a = a
  HK Delta a = DeltaReturn a
```

Next the `Citizen` is declared to have a delta, defined as
simply the `Citizen'` in the `Delta state`. This library is designed
to work with data such as this, and so no further definitions are needed.
DeltaAlways, calcDelta, and applyDelta are derived via Generic mechanisms.

```haskell
instance HasDelta Citizen where
  type DeltaOf Citizen = Citizen' Delta
```

Here we demonstrate a calculated difference between two
citizens, Mary and Mark.
```haskell
mary :: Citizen
mary = Citizen "Mary" "Police"
mark :: Citizen
mark = Citizen "Mark" "Police"
compMaryMark = calcDelta mary mark
-- compMaryMark = Citizen {name = Changed "Mark"
--                        , occupation = Unchanged}

```
Here we demonstrate the patching of a Citizen with a delta
```haskell
mayorMike :: Citizen
mayorMike = Citizen  "Mike" "Mayor"
mayorMark = applyDelta mayorMike compMaryMark
-- mayorMark = Citizen {name = "Mark", occupation = "Mayor"}
```

## Detecting Changes
As noted, the 'Changed' constructor belongs to the `Change` type. And
this library provides special handling for Change deltas.
Specifically, it allows `Unchanged` values to be propagated down a delta,
such that all unchanged fields result in an `Unchanged` delta.

For instance first observe the following delta is the same as Unchanged

```haskell
dMaryMary = calcDelta mary mary
-- dMaryMary = Citizen {name = Unchanged, occupation = Unchanged}
```
That is, if we apply it to any value, x, we must get, x.
applyDelta x dMaryMary == x

We can capture this equality by specifying the DeltaOf as a Change Type

```haskell
instance HasDelta Citizen where
  type DeltaOf Citizen = Change (Citizen' Delta)
```

the calculation dMaryMary now results in.

```haskell
-- dMaryMary = Unchanged
```

## Multiple Constructor Deltas

There is another special type, `Revise`, this libraries version of Either.
It is used when a data type has more than one construction.

```haskell
type Vehicle = Vehicle' Z
data Vehicle' f = Car { carType :: HK f Text }
               | CrashedCar { howBad :: HK f Text } deriving (Generic)
deriving instance (Constraints (Vehicle' f) Show)
  => Show (Vehicle' f)

instance HasDelta Vehicle where
  type DeltaOf Vehicle = Change (Vehicle' Delta)
  --type DeltaAlways = False (derived by a type family)
```

Now, two different Cars will result in an 'Update (DeltaOf)'

```haskell
colorDiff = calcDelta (Car "red" :: Vehicle) (Car "blue")
--colorDiff = Update (Changed (Car {carType = Changed "blue"}))

```
A difference in different constructors just returns the second value, since
the two different constructions cannot be generically compared.

```haskell
carDiff = calcDelta (Car "red"::Vehicle) (CrashedCar "very bad")
-- carDiff = Replace (CrashedCar {howBad = "very bad"})

```
Additionally, because `Revise` is traversable, we can quickly find that
whether or not a 'Revise a (Change b)' is a change, via `sequenceA`

```haskell
colorDiff' = sequenceA colorDiff
-- colorDiff' = Changed (Update (Car {carType = Changed "blue"}))
colorDiff'' = sequenceA $ calcDelta (Car "red" :: Vehicle)(Car "red" :: Vehicle)
-- colorDiff'' = Unchanged
```
